# Selenium Bootcamp


###About:

Using both the [online](https://saucelabs.com/resources/selenium-bootcamp/) and PDF (found in my repository) versions of this bootcamp, I walked through the instructions and it's examples to get a feel for building a basic set of GUI acceptance tests (checks) in Ruby using RSpec.

Both versions written by Dave Haeffner and provided by [SauceLabs](http://www.saucelabs.com).

##To Use:

1. Download files
2. Update config_cloud.rb file for SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
3. Run the tests in command line '''rspec -r ./config_cloud.rb
'''
